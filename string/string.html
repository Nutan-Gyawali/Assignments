            and
            blue hues lies a profound message. The two triangles represent the towering Himalayas, signifying
            Nepal’s lofty aspirations and resilience. The crescent moon symbolizes peace, while the sun radiates
            bravery and an immortal history. Despite being sandwiched between international powers, Nepal has
            maintained peace—a testament to its friendly nature.
